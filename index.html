  <h3> Who am I? </h3>
  <p> My name is Danny Garcia and I am a second year Computer Science student studying here at Illinois Insitute of Technology, and below is my face </p>

  <p> Questioning it's placement, size, as well as the format of the website as a whole, well me too, but I haven't gotten to the point where I can change that, but maybe someday! Anyways if you're looking to hire a person with a few questionable skills then feel free to go over to the top and click on the Resume to maybe hire a person who can work for only about $12 an hour because I know my worth. If not, then maybe the other link will be more appealing!
