# Project2ITMD361

A repository dedicated to Project 2 of the class ITMD 361. This project is centered around html and css, to create responsive and ready html pages with css styling.

Worth noting is that there are not as many commits as one would usually have because I tested out my files on my pc before updating the files here on github to ensure that I wouldn't have to continue with the commit process everytime I wanted to fix a minor mistake. Nevertheless I still refined my code a bit on here to ensure that it functioned correctly and smoothly when integrated with other files.
